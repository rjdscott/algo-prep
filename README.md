# Data Structures and Algorithms Prep

This is prep repo for Data Structures and Algorithms Interviews in python

## Pattern Recognition Crash Course

This repo will contain jupyter notebooks containing detailed guides into fundamental patterns, and an easy, medium and difficult problem and accompanying
solutions with step by step guide.

Topic Lessons:
* Two Pointers (1 hour) - Container with most water, 3Sum
* Sliding Window (1 hour) - Longest substring without repeating chars
* Binary Search (1 hour) - Find minimum in rotated sorted array
* Fast/Slow Pointers (1 hour) - Linked list cycle
* BFS/DFS (1 hour) - Number of islands, clone graph
* Basic DP (1 hour) - Climbing stairs, house robber

Focus: Recognize the pattern, write working code, explain complexity
